# Git-wip #

`git-wip` is a [git][git] extension to make working with continually rebased and
force-pushed work-in-progress branches a breeze.

## Installation ##

Run `make install` for a system installation or `make user-install` for a user
installation into `~/.local/`.

If you run a user installation you'll probably want to add something similar to
the following to your `~/.bashrc` to enable bash completion:

```shell
### Completion
for comp in ${HOME}/.config/bash_completion.d/*; do
    if [ -f "${comp}" ] ; then
        . "${comp}"
    fi
done

```

## Examples ##

Run an interactive rebase on all commits in your wip (work-in-progress) branch:

```shell
$ git wip reapply
```

View the log of this wip branch:

```shell
$ git wip log
```

Add some fixup- and squash commits:

```shell
$ echo "Cool changes!" >> README.md
$ git wip fixup -a
$ echo "Dependency: zlib=1.2.0" >> deps.json
$ git wip squash -a
```

To perform the actual fixup/squash:

```shell
$ git wip autosquash
```

And to test that everything went fine (and you didn't introduce any non-building
commits):

```shell
$ git wip for-all "make clean; make"
```
